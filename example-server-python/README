Example M2M server
=========================

Requirements:
The server code makes use of the Flask web framework 
as well as the google maps extension for Flask.

to ensure you have the required packages,
please install them with pip (the python package manager: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html):
	`pip install Flask`
	`pip install flask-googlemaps`

Once the above packages are installed you can run the server with:
	`python m2mServer.py`

The debug flag for Flask is currently set to True (line 27 of m2mServer.py),
this should help you to debug any issues you might encounter (it also
automatically reload the server if you make any changes to m2mServer.py),
but feel free to set it to false for less verbose output.
